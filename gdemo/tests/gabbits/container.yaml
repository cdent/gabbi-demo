# A container is a first level resource which operates as a
# namespace. It has a meaningless 'owner'.
#

tests:

    - name: create a first container
      desc: we are asking the server to provide an id
      url: /
      method: POST
      request_headers:
          content-type: application/json
      data:
          owner: sam
      status: 201
      response_headers:
          location: /$SCHEME://$NETLOC//

    - name: get that container
      desc: the id that we don't know is in the location
      url: $LOCATION
      response_headers:
          content-type: application/json
      response_json_paths:
          $.owner: sam
